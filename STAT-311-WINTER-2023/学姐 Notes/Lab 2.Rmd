```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
colnames(present)
unique(present$year)
dim(present)

data <- present
```


How do these counts compare to Abruthnot's? Are they of similar?
```{r}
present
arbuthnot
```

*Answer*: The counts in the in the arbuthnot is lower than the counts in the present dataset. This is because the arbuthnot dataset has baptism records for the 1600s. 

Make a plot that displays the proportion of boys born over time. What do you see? Does Arbuthnot's observation about boys being in greater proportion than girls hole up in the US?

```{r}
boys_df <- present %>%
    mutate(total = boys + girls, 
           prop_boys = boys / total)

ggplot(data = boys_df, aes(x = year, y = prop_boys)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
```


In what year did we see the most total number of births in the US?

```{r}
present %>%
  mutate(total = boys + girls) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))
```

```{r}
present %>%
  select(girls)
```

```{r}
present %>%
  filter(year == 1990)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
